DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Any label referenced by a goto statement shall be declared in the same block,
or in a block enclosing the goto statement. Unconstrained use of goto can
lead to programs that are extremely difficult to comprehend, analyse and,
for C++, can also lead to the program exhibiting unspecified behaviour.
However, in many cases a total ban on goto requires the introduction of
flags to ensure correct control flow, and it is possible that these flags
may themselves be less transparent than the goto they replace.
Therefore, the restricted use of goto is allowed where that use will not lead
to semantics contrary to developer expectations. Jumping in to nested blocks is
prohibited as it may lead to complex flow graphs."
