Ensure resources are freed [BD-RES-LEAKS-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps to ensure that allocated resources are deallocated on all paths.
Violations of the rule identify execution paths in an application where resources
are leaked.

The rule can identify leaks of any type of resource. The set of resources whose
leaks are to be detected is defined at
"Test Configurations -&gt; Static -&gt; Options -&gt; BugDetective -&gt; Resources" tab.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Failure to close resources may lead to starvation, which could have
security implications.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Assume third-party functions could store resource references"
parameter allows you to determine how strict the rule is when a reference
to a resource may be stored by a third-party function. For example, if there is a
third-party function SpecialCollection.add() and a resource is passed as a parameter
to this function, it will be stored in a collection and may later be closed by iterating
over the collection. Since BugDetective does not know the exact behavior of arbitrary
third-party functions, it behaves in either of the following ways:

   * With this parameter enabled (the default), BugDetective assumes that any
     third-party function may store reference to a resource if the resource is
     passed into the function. This prevents it from reporting false positives if
     the resource is later closed using the stored reference.
     However, this may also lead to false negatives (real leaks are not reported
     as violations).

   * With this parameter disabled, BugDetective takes a more aggressive approach: It
     assumes that third-party functions do not affect resources in any way. This
     approach may lead to some false positives, but it will not overlook some
     of the real leaks that the default approach may miss.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Having a strict policy with respect to closing resources helps to make an application more
robust by preventing resource starvation.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that triggers violations. (Please note that in order for BugDetective
to find violations in the example, "Files (stdio.h)" must be turned on in the resource
table on "Test Configurations -&gt; Static -&gt; Options -&gt; BugDetective -&gt; Resources" tab):

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static void fileAllocation()
{
	FILE* p = fopen("file.name", "r");
}

static void fileReallocation()
{
	FILE* p = fdopen(0, "file.name");
	p = freopen("file.name", "r", p);
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The following code will not trigger violations:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static void fileAllocation()
{
	FILE* p = fopen("file.name", "r");
	fclose(p);
}

static void fileReallocation()
{
	FILE* p = fdopen(0, "file.name");
	p = freopen("file.name", "r", p);
	fclose(p);
}
