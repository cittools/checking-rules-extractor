Pointers to pointers should be avoided whenever possible [JSF-169-4]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects if code uses pointers to pointers.
"Pointers to pointers should whenever possible be avoided.
By improving the readability of code, the probability of failure is reduced."


Exceptions:

"One exception to this rule is represented by functions which provide 
interfaces to other languages (such as C). These are likely to only allow
pre-defined data types to be used as arguments in the interface, in which
case pointers to pointers are needed. Another example is the second argument
to the main function, which must have the type char*[]."

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves the readability of the code and encourages data abstraction.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void foo() {
    int** a;  // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Instead, declare a class that has
a member variable of the pointer type.
