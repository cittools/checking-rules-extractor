#include statements in a file should only be preceded by other preprocessor directives or comments [MISRA2004-19_1-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"All the #include statements in a particular code file should be grouped
together near the head of the file. The rule states that the only items which
may precede a #include in a file are other preprocessor directives or comments."



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It is important to prevent the situation of executable code coming before
a #include directive, otherwise there is danger that the code may try to use 
items which would be defined in the header.

EXAMPLE

void foo();
int g;
#include "test.h"  // Violation



</PRE>

REPAIR
