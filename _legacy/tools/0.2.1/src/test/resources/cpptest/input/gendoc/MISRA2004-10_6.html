DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Signedness of constants should be explicit. Consistent signedness
is an important principle in constructing well formed expressions.
If a constant is of an unsigned type, it is helpful to avoid
ambiguity by applying a “U” suffix."
The rule reports a violation message if to an unsigned variable is assigned
a constant without 'U' suffix.
