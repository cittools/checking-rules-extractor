DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A variable must always be initialized before use. Normally, the compiler gives 
a warning if a variable is undefined. It is then sufficient to take care of 
such cases. Instances of a class are usually initialized even if no arguments 
are provided in the declaration (the empty constructor is invoked). To declare 
a variable that has been initialized in another file, the keyword extern 
is always used.
By always initializing variables, instead of assigning values to them before 
they are first used, the code is made more efficient since no temporary objects 
are created for the initialization. For objects having large amounts of data, 
this can result in significantly faster code."


Exceptions:

Exception to this rule are 'volatile' data, non-primitive types, and arrays.
