DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Any integer constant beginning with a '0' (zero) is treated as octal. 
So there is a danger, for example, with writing fixed length constants.
Octal escape sequences can be problematic because the inadvertent
introduction of a decimal digit ends the octal escape and introduces
another character. It is better not to use octal constants or escape
sequences at all and to statically check for any occurrences.
The integer constant zero (written as a single numeric digit) is, strictly
speaking, an octal constant, but is a permitted exception to this rule.
Additionally \0 is the only permitted octal escape sequence."


Exceptions:

Rule ignores any #pragma parasoft / codewizard directives.
Rule ignores any values inside asm blocks.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Rule increases readability and maintainability. 
Rule prevents using implementation-defined values.
