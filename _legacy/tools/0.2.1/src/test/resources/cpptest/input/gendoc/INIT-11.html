DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If you write operator=, this rule ensures that you assigned to every
data member of your object.
The rule checks if a member variable is initialized:
- inside body of assignment operator
- inside body of function called from assignment operator
  (three levels of nested function's calls are checked).
See also: MRM-43



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that member variable might be initialized 
by passing its non-const pointer to an external function.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Assign to all member variables in operator= function in order to prevent
data corruption.

class C
{
public:
    C&amp; operator=(const C&amp;);
private:
    int mem_a;
    int mem_b;
    int mem_c;
    int mem_d;
};

C&amp; C::operator=(const C&amp;) // Violation - mem_a, mem_b, mem_c, mem_d - not assigned
{
}

class C
{
public:
    C&amp; operator=(const C&amp;);
    void init();
    void init2();
    void getPtr(int *);
private:
    int mem_a;  // assigned inside operator= body
    int mem_b;  // assigned inside function 'init' called from operator=
    int mem_c;  // assigned inside function 'init2' called from 'init'
    int mem_d;  // its non-const pointer is passed to an external function.
};

void C::init()
{
    mem_b = 2;
    init2();
}

void C::init2()
{
    mem_c = 2;
}

C&amp; C::operator=(const C&amp;) // OK - all members are assigned
{
    mem_a = 1;
    init();
    getPtr(&amp;mem_d);
}
