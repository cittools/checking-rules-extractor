DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If the declaration of a function includes the static storage class specifier,
then it has internal linkage. A re-declaration of such a function is not
required to have the static keyword, but it will still have internal linkage.
However, this is implicit and may not be obvious to a developer. It is therefore
good practice to apply the static keyword consistently so that the linkage
is explicitly stated."
