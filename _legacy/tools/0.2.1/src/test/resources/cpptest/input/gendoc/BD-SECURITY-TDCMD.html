Protect against command injection [BD-SECURITY-TDCMD-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects cases when data coming directly from the end-user can influence
the code which is executed (for example, to form the name of the file to
be executed).

The rule supports functions for process execution from the standard C library as well
as from POSIX. For example, it considers widely used system() function and the exec family
of functions dangerous.

Data from the following data sources are considered tainted:

   * Parameters of the main() function
   * Network

Additional sources of tainted data can be defined by parameterizing the rule.
For details, see the PARAMETERS section.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Enforces 'A2 - Injection Flaws', #2 from the OWASP Top 10 2007 list.

If some tainted data will appear in an executed file name without verification,
it may allow the execution of custom malicious code which could damage the system.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule can be parameterized so that data from the following data sources are considered tainted
(in addition to those previously listed in the DESCRIPTION section):

   * Files
   * Pipes
   * Stream-oriented APIs (std::istream, CArchive and CFile from MFC)
   * Low-level input (Windows API, POSIX)
   * Console
   * Environment variables

The rule can be parameterized with a list of validating functions.
Any validating function can be defined as:
   * returning benign data, and/or;
   * making its parameter(s) benign, and/or;
   * making this-object benign.

Validation functions allow this data to be safely passed
to dangerous functions.

Below is the description of columns which allow to define different aspects of
functions in validating function table: 

* The 'Enabled' column can be used to temporarily disable some of the defined functions
  for BugDetective analysis.

* The 'Fully qualified type name' column must be filled with the fully qualified name of the type
  that declares the function. Use '*' if you want to describe function declared in any type
  or namespace, or a global function declared outside of any type or namespace.

* The 'Function name' column should contain name of the described function.

* The '+ definitions in subclasses' column is used to indicate whether the current row will
  apply to functions with the given in name defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this
  applies to both instance and non-instance functions.
  
Other columns allow to describe which of the data are affected by a given function:

* The '"this" object is validated' column is used to specify that the function cleans object on which
  it is called.

* The 'returns validated data' column is used to specify that the function cleans its return value.

* The 'Numbers of the parameters that are validated (1-based)' column is used to specify that
  the function cleans some of its parameters. List parameters' indexes separated by comma
  or use '*' to specify that all parameters are affected.

Also, there is an option that determines whether numerical data should be considered tainted.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Consider a network application that receives some user-defined parameters from a socket and
starts some processing using these parameters. In such situations, placing unverified user data into
an execution request can have some dangerous consequences. For example, users might be able to
run custom code on the server with application privileges.

For instance, providing " &amp; shutdown -s -f -d p" as a command_parameter value in the request
will cause a server to shutdown if the command is executed in the following way:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

void commandInjection(int socket)
{
	char params[200], command[250];
	recv(socket, params, 200, 0); /* Receiving command parameters from a socket */
	strcpy(command, "process_data -params ");
	strcat(command, params);
	system(command); // Command injection
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Validating tainted data prior to its usage in the dangerous function removes
the risk of command injection:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

char* validate(char*); /* properly implement validation function */

void commandInjection(int socket)
{
	char params[200], command[250];
	recv(socket, params, 200, 0); /* Receiving command parameters from a socket */
	strcpy(command, "process_data -params ");
	strcat(command, validate(params));
	system(command); /* OK, protected from command injection provided that validate() is implemented properly */
}
