DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule warns you if you do not check the return value of new. 
"Until 1993, C++ required that operator new return null when it was unable to 
allocate the requested memory. Operator new is now specified to throw
a bad_alloc exception, but a lot of C++ was written before compilers began 
supporting the revised specification. The C++ standardization committee didn't 
want to abandon the test-for-null code base, so they provided alternative forms
of operator new that offer the traditional failure-yields-null behavior. These
forms are called "nothrow" forms, in part because they employ nothrow objects 
(defined in the header &lt;new&gt;) at the point where new is used."

#include &lt;new&gt;

{
    char *pc;
    pc = new char[10*10*10];      // Violation

    delete[] pc;
    int *p;
    if(p){
        /*code here*/ 
    }
    p = new int;                  // Violation
