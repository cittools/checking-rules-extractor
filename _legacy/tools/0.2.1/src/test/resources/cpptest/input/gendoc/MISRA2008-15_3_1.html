Exceptions shall be raised only after start-up and before termination of the program [MISRA2008-15_3_1-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Before the program starts executing the body of main, it is in a start-up
phase, constructing and initializing static objects. Similarly, after main has
returned, it is in a termination phase where static objects are being
destroyed. If an exception is thrown in either of these phases it leads to the
program being terminated in an implementation-defined manner."

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Throwing an exception during start-up or termination results in the program
being terminated in an implementation-defined manner."

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class C
{
public:
    C ( )
    {
        throw ( 0 ); // Violation – thrown before main starts
    }
    ~C ( )
    {
        throw ( 0 ); // Violation – thrown after main exits
    }
};
C c;

int main( ... )
{ 
	// ...
}
