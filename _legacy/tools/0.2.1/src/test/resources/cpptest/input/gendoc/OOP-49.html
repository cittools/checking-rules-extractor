Casts from a base class to a derived class should not be performed on polymorphic types [OOP-49-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A downcast occurs when a class type is converted to another class type
that is derived from that first class.
Polymorphism enables strong abstraction between the interface and implementation
of a hierarchy. Explicit casts bypass this layer of abstraction resulting
in higher levels of coupling and dependency."
"Casting from a base class to a derived class is unsafe unless some mechanism
is provided to ensure that the cast is legitimate."

Prevents illegal casts and ensures that abstraction layer is not bypassed.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class B
{
    public:
    virtual int foo( );
};

class D : public B
{
    public:
    int foo( );
};
 
void main( )
{
    B *b;
    D *d;
    d = (D*) b; // Violation
}
