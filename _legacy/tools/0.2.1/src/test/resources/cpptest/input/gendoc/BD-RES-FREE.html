Do not use resources that have been freed [BD-RES-FREE-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects uses of resources that have been freed. In particular, a violation is reported
when a pointer or reference to a freed resource is:

   * returned from a function,
   * passed as a parameter to a function,
   * used in an arithmetic operation,
   * dereferenced, or
   * assigned to a variable/field/array element.

The rule can identify violations for any type of resource. The set of resources
is defined in the "Test Configurations -&gt; Static -&gt; Options -&gt; BugDetective -&gt; Resources" tab.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Report violation when pointer to freed resource is compared to null" check box
unsupresses/suppresses  violations where a pointer to a freed resource is compared to a null
pointer. This may be allowed by the code writing policy and application design.
By default, such violations are not reported.

The "Report violation when pointer to freed resource is compared to other pointers" check box
unsuppresses/suppresses violations where a pointer to a freed resource is compared to other
pointers. This may be allowed by the code writing policy and application design.
By default, such violations are not reported.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Prevents strange, often non-deterministic errors elated to the use of freed resources.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that will trigger a violation:

int compute(int* buffer, const int size)
{
	int result = 0;
	// perform computations
	delete[] buffer;
	return result;
}

void process(const int size)
{
	int* buffer = new int[size];
	int result = compute(buffer, size);
	delete[] buffer;
	// do something
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Removing delete in the compute() function repairs the example above. (Please note that in order for BugDetective
to find violations in the example, "Memory (standard C++)" must be turned on in the resource
table on "Test Configurations -&gt; Static -&gt; Options -&gt; BugDetective -&gt; Resources" tab):

int compute(int* buffer, const int size)
{
	int result = 0;
	// perform computations
	return result;
}

void process(const int size)
{
	int* buffer = new int[size];
	int result = compute(buffer, size);
	delete[] buffer;
	// do something
}
