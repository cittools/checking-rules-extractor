DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Expressions with type (plain) char and wchar_t shall not be used as operands
to built-in operators other than the assignment operator =, the equality
operators == and !=, and the unary &amp; operator."


Exceptions:

Exceptionally, the following operators may be used if the associated
restriction is observed:
- The binary + operator may be used to add an integral
  value in the range 0 to 9 to ‘0’;
- The binary – operator may be used to subtract character ‘0’;
- The relational operators &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;= may be used to determine
  if a character (or wide character) represents a digit.
  (Rule does not report a violation if a character constant is compared
   with a variable of type plain char)
