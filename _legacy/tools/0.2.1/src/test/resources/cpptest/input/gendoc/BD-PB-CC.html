Avoid conditions that always evaluate to the same value [BD-PB-CC-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule identifies conditions that always evaluate to the same value. Such conditions
often appear in the course of refactoring and during code evolution -- especially when
code is edited by multiple developers. Often, the existence of such conditions indicates
logical errors in code. Additionally, such conditions may indicate overly loose assumptions, 
which results in less efficient code and fragments of dead code (as shown below in the example section).

How it works:
This rule inspects conditions present in the code and determines whether they are redundant. 
To achieve this, it examines all the code paths that lead to the condition. If it finds that 
the condition evaluates to the same value on all these paths, it reports a violation.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
When both the condition and the code that makes this condition constant are within
the same function, this almost always indicates a problem with the logic. When
one of these is in a different function, a more careful review is needed before
proceeding to fix the reported violation. The review is important because even though
an obvious solution may be to remove the check, it is possible that the check
protects against future changes.

Helps you keep code in good shape and weed out logical inconsistencies as soon as they
are introduced.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example which triggers a violation due to a presence of a dead code fragment:

#include "stdio.h"

void processHexValue(char*);

static void checkRange(char* cur)
{
	if ((*cur &lt; '0') || (*cur &gt; '9')) {
		printf("Error: only digits are permitted");
		return;
	}
	// obviously dead code
	if ((*cur &gt;= 'a') &amp;&amp; (*cur &lt;= 'f')) {
		processHexValue(cur);
	}
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
To repair the code, remove the redundant check:

#include "stdio.h"

static void checkRange(char* cur)
{
	if ((*cur &lt; '0') || (*cur &gt; '9')) {
		printf("Error: only decimal digits are permitted");
		return;
	}
}
