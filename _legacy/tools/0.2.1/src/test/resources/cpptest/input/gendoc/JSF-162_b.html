Avoid implicit conversions between signed and unsigned integer types [JSF-162_b-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The value of an expression of integer type shall not be implicitly
converted to a different underlying type.
The term 'underlying type' is defined as describing the type that would
be obtained from evaluating an expression if it were not for the effects
of integral promotion."
Rule checks if implicit conversions between signed and unsigned types are used
when variables are initialized.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"By observing the principle whereby all operations are performed in 
a consistent (underlying) type, it is possible to avoid programmer confusion 
and some of the dangers associated with integral promotion."

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void Conv1_int( )
{
    unsigned int u32a;
    signed int s32a = u32a;                 /* Violation */
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void Conv1_int( )
{
    unsigned int u32a;
    signed int s32a = (signed int)u32a;     /* OK */
}
