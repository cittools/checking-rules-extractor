The right-hand operand of a logical &amp;&amp; or || operator shall not contain side effects [MISRA2004-12_4_a-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"There are some situations in C or C++ where certain parts of expressions may
not be evaluated. If these sub-expressions contain side effects then those side
effects may or may not occur, depending on the values of other sub expressions.
The operators which can lead to this problem are &amp;&amp; and || where the evaluation
of the right-hand operand is conditional on the value of the left-hand operand.
The operations that cause side effects are accessing a volatile object,
modifying an object, modifying a file, or calling a function that does
any of those operations, which cause changes in the state of the execution
environment of the calling function."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule checks only three nested level of fuction call.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents conditional evaluation of the right-hand operand that can easily
cause problems if the developer relies on a side effect occurring.

void foo( ) {
    int i;
    int j;
    if ((j == i) || (0 == i)) i++; // OK
