DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Null statements should not normally be deliberately included, but where they
are used they shall appear on a line by themselves.
White-space characters may precede the null statement to preserve indentation.
If a comment follows the null statement then at least one white-space character 
shall separate the null statement from the comment. 
The use of a white-space character to separate the null statement from any
following comment is required on the grounds that it provides an important 
visual cue to reviewers."

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Following this rule enables a static checking tool to 
warn of null statements appearing on a line with other text, 
which would normally indicate a programming error."
