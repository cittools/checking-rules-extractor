DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

As defined by ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard,a side effect is defined as: 
"Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file, 
or calling a function that does any of those operations are all side effects, 
which are changes in the state of the execution environment." 

A null statement is, according to the standard, a statement 
"consisting of just a semicolon." 
This rule will report a violation message each time a non-null statement 
(i.e. statement consisting of just a semicolon) is detected with no 
side-effects. 
For example, if an expression evaluation result is not used, 
because a programmer forgot 
to use assignment operator to store the value, 
or because he accidentally wrote "==" instead of "=", 
the statement is considered not to have a side effect. 
Such programming errors are potentially disastrous. 

This rule will also report violation if an empty block statement is detected, 
since such a statement has no effect. 
Empty function body is not considered as violating this rule. 
For purposes of this rule any function call is considered as 
having side effects, even if no variable is modified as a result 
of the function call.
