Prefer non-member non-friend functions to member functions [CODSTA-CPP-22-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The non-member approach is thus better than a member function in many ways.
The member function actually yields less encapsulation than the non-member.
Furthermore, offering the non-member function allows for greater packaging
flexibility, related functionality, and that, in turn, yields fewer compilation 
dependencies and an increase extensibility.
Friends have the same access to a class's private members that member functions
have, hence the same impact on encapsulation. From an encapsulation point
of view, the choice isn't between member and non-member functions, it's between
member functions and non-member non-friend functions."
Rule reports violation on the member functions which call public functions
and don't have the access to private and protected members.
