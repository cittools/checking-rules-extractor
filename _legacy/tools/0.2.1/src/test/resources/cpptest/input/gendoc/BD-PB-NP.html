<PRE>
"Report violations where variable is known to be null due to a null check" check box:
This check box allows you to specify which violations should be reported:

   * Only those where BD can prove that a certain variable gets assigned a null value;
   * Violations in the above category, plus violations where there is no null value assignment but a check
     for a null value that stipulates null pointer dereferencing at the point of use.

Here is sample code for the latter case:

    int b = (ptr == 0); // null check that stipulates null dereferencing at violation point
    ...
    if (b) {
        ...
        int i = *ptr; // violation reported if the check box is ticked
    }

"Functions that do not accept NULL as their parameters" table:
Allows you to enumerate functions whose parameters are not allowed to accept null.
Parameterization details:
'Enabled' column: 
Should be used to include/exclude an already defined function from taking 
into account during the analysis.

'Fully qualified type name or namespace' column:
Allows for the specification of the entity the function is declared within. 
If this field is left empty, only the global function with the name specified 
in 'Function name' column will be considered.
If this field is filled with '*', function declared in any type
or namespace, or a global function declared outside of any type or namespace will be
considered.

'Function name' column:
The name of the function should be specified here.

'+ definitions in subclasses' column:
This is to indicate whether the function definitions in subclasses should be considered 
as well. This applies to both instance and non-instance functions and makes sense only 
if the declaring type is specified.

'Numbers of the parameters not allowing NULL (1-based, comma-separated)' column:
Allows you to specify the list of ordinal numbers of the function parameters that are not 
allowed to accept null. These numbers should be 1-based and separated by comma (Example: 1,3),
or '*' can be used to specify that all parameters are not allowed to accept null.


"External functions that may return NULL" table:
This rule can also be parameterized to consider functions that can potentially
return null. To achieve better results, the rule provides a predefined set of such
null returners from standard libraries. Those predefined functions are used by
default. They can not be edited or removed from the list, but can be enabled/disabled by using 
check box in the 'Enabled' column.
Additionally, you can extend the set of null returners to include additional functions that
you assume being capable to return null.

Parameterization details:
Similar to those for "Functions that do not accept NULL as their parameters" table described above
except there is no 'Numbers of the parameters not allowing NULL (1-based, comma-separated)' column.

A step-by-step example of how to create your own null returner is provided in the 'EXAMPLE' 
section of this help page.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Example#1 - Some code excerpts for which the rule reports a violation:

static void nullPointerDereference()
{
    int* pointerToNull = 0;
    int variable = *pointerToNull; // VIOLATION
}

static void zeroTracking()
{
    int pointerValue = 0;
    int* pointerToNull = pointerValue;
    int variable = *pointerToNull; // VIOLATION
}

static void multiPointer()
{
    int* zero = 0;
    int** ppi = &amp;zero;
    int* pi = *ppi;
    int k = *pi; // VIOLATION
}


Example#2 - custom null returner creation:
Consider the following code assuming createInstance() being potential null returner:

namespace mySpace {
    class MyClass
    {
        public:
            int getNumber();
            static MyClass* createInstance();
    };
}

static void usingFactory()
{
    mySpace::MyClass* instance = mySpace::MyClass::createInstance();
    int num = instance-&gt;getNumber(); // VIOLATION
}

In order to detect possible null pointer dereferencing in the code above, 
the rule should be parameterized as follows:

 - Add custom null returner:
       'Fully qualified type name or namespace' field value: "mySpace::MyClass";
       'Function name' field value: "createInstance";
       Use '+ definitions in subclasses' if createInstance() defined in subclasses
       of mySpace::MyClass may return null as well.
