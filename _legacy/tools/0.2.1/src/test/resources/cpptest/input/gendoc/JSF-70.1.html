Freed memory shouldn't be accessed under any circumstances. Destructor should not be called manually [JSF-70.1-2]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"(..) invalid objects (...) wreak havoc on your program's health.
Don't make assumptions about what delete does and doesn't do; 
freed memory is freed, and shouldn't be subsequently 
accessed under any circumstances. Don't try to play with object lifetime 
by calling the destructor manually (e.g. obj.~T())."



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule checks only simple cases (usage of variable, parameter, 
a[b], a.b, a-&gt;b, or *a expression after they were deleted).



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents writing unsafe and error prone code.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class A {
public:
    ~A();
};

void zoo( ) {
    A obj;
    obj.~A( );    // Violation
}

void foo( ) {	
    char * a = new char;
    char * b = new char;

    delete a;
    a++;          // Violation
    delete b;
};



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Don't use invalid objects.
