BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevention of resource leaks, especially in error cases.
Releasing resources in a destructor provides a convenient means of resource
management, especially in regards to exceptional cases. Moreover, if it is
possible that a resource could be leaked, then that resource should be wrapped
in a class whose destructor automatically cleans up the resource.
