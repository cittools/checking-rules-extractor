DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Null statements should not normally be deliberately included, but where they 
are used they shall appear on a line by themselves and not with any other
text (including comments). Following this rule enables a static checking tool
to warn of null statements appearing on a line with other text, which would 
normally indicate a programming error."
