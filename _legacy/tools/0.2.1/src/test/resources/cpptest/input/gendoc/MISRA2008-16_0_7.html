DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If an attempt is made to use an identifier in a preprocessor directive,
and that identifier has not been defined, 
the preprocessor will sometimes not give any warning but will assume 
the value zero.
#ifdef, #ifndef and defined() are provided to test the existence of a macro,
and are therefore excluded.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Complying with this rule leads to safer code 
and prevents hard-to-detect errors.

<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1) Currently the implementation of the rule assumes that the compliance with 
   the rule is provided by following MISRA 2004 19-11 advice (p. 78):
   "Consideration should be given to the use of a /#ifdef/" test before 
   an identifier is used."

2) If #1 is not followed, due to technical limitations we are not able 
   to recognize cases where preprocessor identifier is defined in different 
   file from that where the identifier is used. Also, we are unable to detect 
   that given identifier was defined as compiler command line option.

3) If tested macro identifier was earlier defined by #define preprocessor 
   directive, it can not be defined in more nested #if / #elif / #else / #endif
   directives. In such cases rule can report false positives.

3) If tested macro identifier is defined within complex conditional statement (containing
   few branches #elif/#else) we cannot be sure if branch containing definition of macro
   being tested is executed. In such case rule may report false positives.

#if X 
/* Violation - X undefined at this point */

#if Y
/* Violation - Y undefined at this point */

#if X + Y
/* Violation - X and Y undefined at this point */

#ifdef X
#define Y 1
#else
#define Y 3
#endif

#if Y &gt; 2  // Violation - because of point 3
