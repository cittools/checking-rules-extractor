DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is purely informational.
It will report a message when a bitfield is declared.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents error prone code.
The ordering of bits in memory varies from compiler to
compiler. In addition, many popular compilers generate
inefficient code for reading and writing bit members,
and there are potentially severe thread safety issues
relating to bit fields (especially on multiprocessor
systems) due to the fact that most machines cannot
manipulate arbitrary sets of bits in memory, but must
instead load and store whole words.
