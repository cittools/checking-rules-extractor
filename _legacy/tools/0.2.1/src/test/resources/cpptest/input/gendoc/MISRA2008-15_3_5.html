DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If a class type exception object is caught by value, slicing occurs. That is,
if the exception object is of a derived class and is caught as the base,
only the base classâ€™s functions (including virtual functions) can be called. 
Also, any additional member data in the derived class cannot be accessed."
Rule detects class or struct type exception object that is caught by value.
