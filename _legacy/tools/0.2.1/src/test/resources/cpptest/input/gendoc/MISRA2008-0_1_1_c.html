DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule refers to code which cannot under any circumstances be reached, 
and which can be identified as such at compile-time. Code that can be reached 
but may never be executed is excluded from the rule (e.g. defensive programming 
code). A portion of code is unreachable if there is no control flow path from 
the relevant entry point to that code."
Rule detects unreachable code inside if/while/for/else block if in a condition 
a constant value is used.
