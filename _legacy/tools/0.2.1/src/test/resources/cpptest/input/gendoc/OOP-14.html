Consider use composition instead of private inheritance [OOP-14-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Use composition whenever you can, and use private inheritance whenever you
must. When must you? Primarily when protected members and/or virtual functions
enter the picture, though there's also an edge case where space concerns can
tip the scales toward private inheritance.(...) it applies only when you're
dealing with a class that has no data in it. Such classes have no non-static
data members; no virtual functions (because the existence of such functions
adds a vptr to each object — see Item 7); and no virtual base classes (because
such base classes also incur a size overhead — see Item 40)."

"Private inheritance means nothing during software design, only during
software implementation. And it is useful only in some edge cases."
