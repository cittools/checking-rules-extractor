DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There are, of course, issues that may not be readily 
apparent at the beginning of the project. For instance, 
in 64-bit applications, longs and pointers are larger, which 
also increases the size of a structure containing these 
data types. The layout of your structure elements 
determines how much space is required by the structure. 
For example, a structure that contains an integer followed 
by a long in a 32-bit application is 8 bytes, but a 64-bit 
application adds 4 bytes of padding to the first element 
of the structure to align the second element on its natural 
boundary.
To minimize this padding, reorder the data structure elements 
from largest to smallest. However, if data structure elements 
are accessed as byte streams, you need to change your 
code logic to adjust for the new order of elements in 
the data structure.

NOTES

<PRE>

Following dependencies assumed for this rule:
bool &lt; long
float &lt; double &lt; long double
char &lt; short &lt; int &lt; reference, pointer, long
arrays and objects should be at the beginning of the list of members

BENEFITS

    int i;                // Violation
    void* p;           // Violation
    long int li;        // Violation
