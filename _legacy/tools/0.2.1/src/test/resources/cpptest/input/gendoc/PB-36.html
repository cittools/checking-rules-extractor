An object's dynamic type shall not be used from the body of its constructor or destructor [PB-36-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"During construction and destruction of an object, its final type
may be different to that of the completely constructed object."
"Member functions (including virtual member functions) can be called for an
object under construction. Similarly, an object under construction can be the
operand of the typeid operator or of a dynamic_cast. However, if these
operations are performed in a ctor-initializer (or in a function called
directly or indirectly from a ctor-initializer) before all the mem-initializers
for base classes have completed, the result of the operation is undefined."

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"The result of using an object's dynamic type in a constructor or
destructor may not be consistent with developer expectations."
