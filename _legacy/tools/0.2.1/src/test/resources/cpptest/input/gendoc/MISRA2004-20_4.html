Dynamic heap memory allocation shall not be used [MISRA2004-20_4-3]
</STRONG>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The use of dynamic memory can lead to out-of-storage run-time failures,
which are undesirable. The built-in new and delete operators, other than
the placement versions, use dynamic heap memory. The functions calloc,
malloc, realloc and free also use dynamic heap memory."


Exceptions:

The rule allows to use a placement new.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"There is a range of unspecified, undefined and implementation-defined
behaviour associated with dynamic memory allocation, as well as a number of
other potential pitfalls. Dynamic heap memory allocation may lead to memory
leaks, data inconsistency, memory exhaustion, non-deterministic behaviour."



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo()
{
  int * p = new int[10]; // Violation
  /* ... */
  
  delete[] p;            // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Do not use neither 'new' and 'delete' operators nor 'calloc', 'malloc',
'realloc' and 'free' functions.
