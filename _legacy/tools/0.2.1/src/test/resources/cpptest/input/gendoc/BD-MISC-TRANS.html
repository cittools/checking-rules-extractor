DESCRIPTION

('transaction object') is not closed.

This rule must be parameterized before it is used.

The parameterization dialog consists of two tables: 'Functions that start a transaction'
and 'Functions that terminate a transaction'.

PARAMETERIZATION COMMON TO BOTH TRANSACTION STARTERS AND TERMINATORS
'Enabled' column:
Should be used to include/exclude an already-defined starter/terminator from being taken
into account during the analysis.

'Fully qualified type name or namespace' column:
Allows for specification of the entity the starter/terminator is declared within.
If this field is left empty, only the global function with the name specified
in the 'Function name' column will be considered a transaction starter/terminator.
If this field is filled with '*', the function declared in any type
or namespace-- or a global function declared outside of any type or namespace-- will be
considered a transaction starter/terminator.

'Function name' column:
The name of the transaction starting/terminating function should be specified here.

'+ definitions in subclasses' column:
This is to indicate whether function definitions in subclasses should be considered
starters/terminators as well. This applies to both instance and non-instance functions
and makes sense only if the declaring type is specified.


SETTING UP TRANSACTION STARTERS
The 'Functions that start a transaction' table can be filled with the descriptors of functions
that start a transaction. These can be represented by functions that are able to do any of the following:
	a) Return a transaction object.
	b) Open a transaction on the object that the function is called upon. For example, after the call
	   transaction-&gt;open(); "transaction" is an open transaction that has to be properly closed.
	c) Turn one of its actual parameters into a transaction object.

For any starting function, the fields in the columns labeled 'Returns a transaction object',
'"this" object is a transaction one' and 'Numbers of the parameters for the transaction object (1-based)'
should be used to depict the situation (a, b or c) that takes place. The value of the latter
column is expected to be an ordinal number (1-based) of the affected parameter.
For example, this should be set to "2" if the function designates its second parameter
as a transaction object. Use '*' to specify that all parameters are transaction object.

NOTE ABOUT CONSTRUCTORS
Any transaction starting function with a name (the value of the appropriate field in the
'Function name' column) that is exactly the same as the unqualified name of its declaring type
(the last segment of the value of the field in 'Fully qualified type name or namespace' column)
is considered a constructor. The '"this" object is a transaction one' check box must be ticked
for constructors that represent a starting function.
Changing values in the fields '+ definitions in subclasses', 'Returns a transaction object'
and 'Numbers of the parameters for the transaction object (1-based)' has no effect on the analysis
for constructors.

SETTING UP TRANSACTION TERMINATORS:
The second pane can be filled with functions that terminate a transaction by being
called on the object that is designated as a transaction object, or by being passed a transaction
object as one of their parameters.
As with transaction starters, the fields in the columns labeled '"this" object is a transaction one'
and 'Numbers of the parameters for the transaction object' should be filled appropriately for transaction
terminators.

A step-by-step example of how to correctly perform parameterization is provided in
the 'EXAMPLE' section of this help page.

SPECIFYING THE APPROACH TO REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS AT THE MOMENT OF APPLICATION TERMINATION
The "Do not report violations at application termination"
parameter allows you to manage reporting of violations at the moment of application
termination. The default setting is "off" because it's generally recommended
to close the transaction manually.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Example#1(C-style parameterization):
Consider the following parameterization of the rule:
 - The function that starts a transaction is defined with the name 'start'
   and the corresponding 'Returns a transaction object' check box is ticked.
 - The function that terminates a transaction is defined with the name 'terminate'
   and '1' is set as the value of the corresponding cell of the
   'Numbers of the parameters for the transaction object' table column.

Being parameterized in this way, the rule detects a violation on the following
sample code:

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

void* start() { }

void terminate(void * a) { }

static void notClosedTransaction()
{
	void* transaction;
	transaction = start();
}



Example#2(C++-style parameterization):
Consider the following sample code:

namespace mySpace {
	class MyTransaction
	{
		public:
			void start();
			void terminate();
			static void terminateTransaction(MyTransaction* p)
			{
			};
	};
}

static void transactionUse()
{
    mySpace::MyTransaction* t = new mySpace::MyTransaction();
    t-&gt;start();
} // 't' is not terminated


In order to detect un-closed transaction in the code above, the rule should be parameterized as follows:

 - Function that starts a transaction:
       'Fully qualified type name or namespace' field value: "mySpace::MyTransaction";
       'Function name' field value: "start";
       '"this" object is a transaction one' check box status: checked.
 - Terminating function:
       'Fully qualified type name or namespace' field value: "mySpace::MyTransaction";
       'Function name' field value: "terminate";
       '"this" object is a transaction one' check box status: checked.
 - Another terminating function:
       'Fully qualified type name or namespace' field value: "mySpace::MyTransaction";
       'Function name' field value: "terminateTransaction";
       'Numbers of the parameters for the transaction object (1-based)' field value: 1.

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
For the Example#1:
By adding a call to terminating function, we repair the code so that
it does not trigger a violation:

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

void* start() { }

void terminate(void * a) { }

static void notClosedTransaction()
{
	void* transaction;
	transaction = start();
	terminate(transaction);
}


For the Example#2:
By adding a call to the terminating function, we repair the code so that
it does not trigger a violation:

namespace mySpace {
	class MyTransaction
	{
		public:
			void start();
			void terminate();
			static void terminateTransaction(MyTransaction* p)
			{
			};
	};
}

static void transactionUse()
{
    mySpace::MyTransaction* t = new mySpace::MyTransaction();
    t-&gt;start();
    t-&gt;terminate(); // mySpace::MyTransaction::terminateTransaction(t); may be used as well
}
