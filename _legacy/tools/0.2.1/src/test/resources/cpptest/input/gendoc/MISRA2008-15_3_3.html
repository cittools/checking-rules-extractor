DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Accessing a non-static member of a class or a base class in the
handler (i.e. the catch part) of a function-try-block of a class
constructor/destructor is not allowed.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The effect of accessing a non-static member of a class or a base class in the
handler (i.e. the catch part) of a function-try-block of a class
constructor/destructor is undefined. For example, if a memory allocation
exception is thrown during creation of the object, the object will not exist
when the handler attempts to access its members. Conversely, in the destructor,
the object may have been successfully destroyed before the exception is
handled, so again will not be available to the handler. By contrast, the
lifetime of a static member is greater than that of the object itself, so the
static member is guaranteed to exist when the handler accesses it."

EXAMPLE

typedef int int32_t;
class C
{
    public:
        int32_t x;
        C( )
    try
    {
        // Action that may raise an exception
    }
    catch ( ... )  // Violation
    {
        if ( 0 == x ) // Non-compliant – x may not exist at this point
        {
            // Action dependent on value of x
        }
    }
    ~C ( )
    try
    {
        // Action that may raise an exception
    }
    catch ( ... )  // Violation
    {
	    if ( 0 == x ) // Non-compliant – x may not exist at this point
        {
            // Action dependent on value of x
        }
    }
};

Do not use non-static member of a class or a base class in the handler
of a function-try-block of a class constructor/destructor
