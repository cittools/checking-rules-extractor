DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Where a data value is to be tested against zero then the test should be made 
explicit. The exception to this rule is when data represents a Boolean value, 
even though in C this will in practice be an integer." 
An 'effectively Boolean' expression which is either 'Boolean-by-construct'
or 'Boolean-by-enforcement' as defined below.
Boolean-by-construct values are produced by the following operators:
- equality operators (== and !=)
- logical operators (!, &amp;&amp; and ||)
- relational operators (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;= and &gt;=)
Boolean-by-enforcement values can be introduced by implementing a specific type
enforcement mechanism using a tool. A Boolean type could be associated with
a specific typedef, and would then be used for any objects that are Boolean."

Rule does not report violation if as an operand of logical operator is used:
- Boolean-by-construct values
- boolean constant
- integer or enum constant defined as '0' or '1' 
- variable, parameter or expression of type:
  - bool,
  - typedef to bool,
  - enum that name begins with 'bool' (ignoring case)
    and that contains exactly 2 enum constant in body
  - typedef to char/short/int/enum which name begins with 'bool' (ignoring case) 
  - reference to above types

Rule does not report violations on constant expressions.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"This rule is in the interests of clarity, and makes clear the distinction
between integers and logical values."
