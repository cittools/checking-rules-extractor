Avoid buffer write overflow from tainted data [BD-SECURITY-OVERFWR-1]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The rule detects when code writes to a buffer and the write operation can go beyond
the buffer boundary.

Specifically, a violation is reported if a 'size' value passed to a function writing to a buffer
comes from a tainting function (e.g., user input) that can return malicious data,
but is not checked for being non-negative (applicable to signed types) and not greater
than the size of the corresponding buffer.

Data from the following data sources are considered tainted:

   * Parameters of the main() function
   * Network

Additional sources of tainted data can be defined by parameterizing the rule.
For details, see the PARAMETERS section.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Possible buffer overflow is a severe security threat.
If an application has a vulnerability of this kind, it can be exploited to
execute arbitrary code and gain full control over the application.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule can be parameterized so that data from the following data sources are considered tainted
(in addition to those previously listed in the DESCRIPTION section):

   * Files
   * Pipes
   * Stream-oriented APIs (std::istream, CArchive and CFile from MFC)
   * Low-level input (Windows API, POSIX)
   * Console
   * Environment variables

The rule can be parameterized with a list of validating functions.
Any validating function can be defined as:
   * returning benign data, and/or;
   * making its parameter(s) benign, and/or;
   * making this-object benign.

Validation functions allow this data to be safely passed
to dangerous functions.

Below is the description of columns which allow to define different aspects of
functions in validating function table: 

* The 'Enabled' column can be used to temporarily disable some of the defined functions
  for BugDetective analysis.

* The 'Fully qualified type name' column must be filled with the fully qualified name of the type
  that declares the function. Use '*' if you want to describe function declared in any type
  or namespace, or a global function declared outside of any type or namespace.

* The 'Function name' column should contain name of the described function.

* The '+ definitions in subclasses' column is used to indicate whether the current row will
  apply to functions with the given in name defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this
  applies to both instance and non-instance functions.
  
Other columns allow to describe which of the data are affected by a given function:

* The '"this" object is validated' column is used to specify that the function cleans object on which
  it is called.

* The 'returns validated data' column is used to specify that the function cleans its return value.

* The 'Numbers of the parameters that are validated (1-based)' column is used to specify that
  the function cleans some of its parameters. List parameters' indexes separated by comma
  or use '*' to specify that all parameters are affected.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that will trigger a violation:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

void example(int src[100], int dest[100])
{
	int size;
	scanf("%d", &amp;size);
	memcpy(dest, src, size); // VIOLATION ("size" is an arbitrary value possibly &lt; 0 or &gt; 100)
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The following code will not trigger a violation:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

void example(int src[100], int dest[100])
{
	int size;
	scanf("%d", &amp;size);
	if (size &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; size &lt;= 100) {
		memcpy(dest, src, size); // NO VIOLATION
	}
}
