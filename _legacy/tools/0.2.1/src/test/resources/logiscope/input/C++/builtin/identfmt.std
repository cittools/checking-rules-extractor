by the compilation unit.

It is possible to define a format for specific categories in each language.
For a complete description of the available categories, please refer to each manual.

A list of couples of character strings; the first string of the 
couple represents the declaration category name, the second one the regular 
expression associated to that declaration category (see Headercom: Module
