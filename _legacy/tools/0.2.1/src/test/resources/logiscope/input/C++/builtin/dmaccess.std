.NAME Access to members data

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
The class interface must be purely functional: members data definitions can be 
limited.

Parameters:
----------
A list of character strings corresponding to the forbidden access specifiers for 
the data members.

Justification:
--------------
The good way to modify the state of an object is via its methods, not its data 
members.
The data members of a class should be private or at least protected.

Example:
--------

In order to prevent the use of data members in the public and protected 
access specifiers, the standard may be expressed as below:
STANDARD dmaccess ON LIST "public" "protected" EN LIST END STANDARD
