.NAME Global variable initialization

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
Global variables must be initialized when they are defined.

Justification:
--------------
Not all compilers give the same default values. Unexpected behaviour can be 
avoided with better control over variable values. Initializing global variables 
when they are declared ensures that they are initialized before being used.
