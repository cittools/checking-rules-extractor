.NAME Prefer C++-style Casts

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
Use the C++-style casts (static_cast, const_cast, dynamic_cast and reinterpret_cast)
instead of the general-purpose C-style cast.
(This rule relates to Item 2 in "More Effective C++", Scott Meyers).

Justification:
--------------
The C-style cast does not allow to make a distinction between the different types
of casts and it is not easy to detect.
