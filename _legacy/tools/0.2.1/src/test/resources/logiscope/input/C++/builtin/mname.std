.NAME File names

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
A file name and the name of the class declared or defined in this file must be 
closely related.
The comparison is made only on alphanumeric characters and is not case sensitive.
The extension of the file name is not taken into account.
The part of the file name taken into account to correspond to the name of the class
is between the MIN and the MAX characters (these included).
This character string should be found in the identifier 
according to the above comparison rules.

Parameters:
----------
A MINMAX couple of values giving the part of the file name to take into account.

Example:
--------

if the MINMAX parameters are 4 and 10, and the file name
is My_Graph_Node.h
then the part of the file name that should be found in
the class name is: GRAPHN
(the first 10 characters: My_Graph_N, minus the first 3: Graph_N, minus non 
alphanumeric characters: GraphN)

Then, the class name that the file is based upon could
be one of the following declarations

class CLA_Graph_Node { ...}
class Graph_Node { ...}
class Graph_Node_Def { ...}
class graphnode { ...}

But not the following ones

class Graph { ...}
class NodeGraph { ...}
