(hidden use), through calls in series.

u.v.a
u.v.f()
u.g().a
u.g().f()

As for expressions using the -> operator.

Example:
--------

myWindow.itsButton.push(); 

You manipulate the myWindow object from the Window class; you access to the 
itsButton attribute; 
you directly call the push method on it. 
But only the Window class and its interface, containing itsButton , are normaly 
known, and not the itsButton attribute class, neither its public methods 
(including push).

Example:
--------

Error->pos.line;

There is a hidden use of line , which is not known from Error.
