.NAME Literal constants

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
Numbers, characters and strings have to be declared as constants instead of being 
used as literals inside a program. The user can list the allowed literal 
constants.

Parameters:
-----------
A list of character strings representing the allowed literal constants.

Note: In the case of constants used in initializing lists 
(concerning array and struct structures), only the first five violations are shown. 

Justification:
--------------
Makes maintenance easier by avoiding the scattering of constants among the code, 
often with the same value.

Example:
--------

// do not write

char tab[100];
int i;
...
if (i == 7) {
p = "Hello World.";
}

// write

#define TAB_SIZE 100
enum i_val { ok =7; ko =11};
const char HelloWorld[] = "Hello World.";
char tab[TAB_SIZE];
i_val i;
...
if (i == ok) {
p = HelloWorld;
}
