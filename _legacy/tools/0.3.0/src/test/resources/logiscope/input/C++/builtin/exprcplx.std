.NAME Expressions complexity

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
Expressions complexity must be smaller than a limit given as a parameter. 
This complexity is calculated with the associated syntactic tree, and its number 
of nodes.
By default, the maximum authorized complexity level is 10.

Parameters:
----------
A number representing the authorized complexity level.

Example:
--------

For instance, this expression: 
(b+c*d) + (b*f(c)*d) 
is composed of 8 operators and 7 operands.

The associated syntactic tree has 16 nodes, so if the limit is under 16, 
there will be a standard violation.
