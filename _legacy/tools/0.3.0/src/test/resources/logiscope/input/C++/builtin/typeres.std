.NAME Reserved types

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
Some types may be forbidden for variables or functions.
It is possible to define the list of types that are forbidden for variables 
(extern , static , and automatic variables) and the list of types that are 
forbidden for functions.
The type specifiers and qualifiers are forbidden in any order and even if 
they are merged with other specifiers or qualifiers.
These types are allowed in typedef definition.

Parameters:
-----------
Two lists of strings beginning by the keywords "data" or "function".
The other items of the list are strings containing the forbidden groups 
of type specifiers or type qualifiers separated by spaces.

Justification:
--------------
Not relying on predefined types improves code portability.

Example:
--------
The standard may be specified as following:

STANDARD typeres ON 
LIST "data" "int" "char" "register double" END LIST
LIST "function" "unsigned int" "double" END LIST 
END STANDARD
