DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Const-correctness is worthwhile, proven, effective, and highly recommended.
Understanding how and where a program's state changes is vital, and const
documents that directly in code where the compiler can help to enforce it.
If you find it impossible to make a member function const, you usually gain
a better understanding of the ways in which that member function might modify
an object's state."
