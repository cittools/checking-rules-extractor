DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When these operators (~ and &lt;&lt;) are applied to small integer types 
(unsigned char or unsigned short),
the operations are preceded by integral promotion, 
and the result may contain high order bits which have not been anticipated.
A similar problem exists when the &lt;&lt; operator is used on small integer types 
and high order bits are retained."

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents high order bits retaining.

	result_8 = (~port) &gt;&gt; 4;                                    /* Violation */
	result_16 = ((port &lt;&lt; 4) &amp; mode) &gt;&gt; 6;                      /* Violation */
