Do not mix bit-fields and other data within the same structure [MISRA2004-3_5-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It is recommended that structures should be declared specifically 
to hold the sets of bit fields, and do not include any other data
within the same structure.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Rule prevents from the potential pitfalls and areas of implementation-defined 
(i.e.non-portable) behaviour such as:
- the alignment of the bit fields in the storage unit is implementation-defined,
  that is whether they are allocated from the high end or low end of the storage
  unit (usually a byte).
- whether or not a bit field can overlap a storage unit boundary is also implementation-defined
  (e.g. if a 6-bit field and a 4-bit field are declared in that order, whether the 4-bit field
  will start a new byte or whether it will be 2 bits in one byte and 2 bits in the next).
