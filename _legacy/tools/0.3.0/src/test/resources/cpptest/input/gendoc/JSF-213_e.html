DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In addition to the use of parentheses to override default operator precedence,
parentheses should also be used to emphasise it. It is easy to make a mistake 
with the rather complicated precedence rules of C, and this approach helps to 
avoid such errors, and helps to make the code easier to read. However, do not 
add too many parentheses so as to clutter the code and make it unreadable.
Use parentheses unless all operators in the expression are the same."
