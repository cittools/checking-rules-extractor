Prefer vector and string to dynamically allocated arrays [STL-10-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The minute you decide to use new for a dynamic allocation, you adopt 
the following responsibilities:
1. You must make sure that somebody will later delete the allocation. 
2. You must ensure that the correct form of delete is used. For 
  an allocation of a single object, "delete" must be used. 
  For an array allocation, "delete []" is required. 
3. You must make sure that delete is used exactly once. 
Any time you find yourself getting ready to dynamically allocate an array,
you should consider using a vector or a string instead.(...) vector and string
eliminate the burdens above, because they manage their own memory. Their
memory grows as elements are added to these containers, and when a vector or
string is destroyed, its destructor automatically destroys the elements in the
container and deallocates the memory holding those elements."
