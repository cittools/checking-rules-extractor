Avoid dereferencing before checking for null [BD-PB-DEREF-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects cases where a reference checked for being null gets dereferenced
on any path leading to this check.

In some cases, the checks for null might have become redundant in the course of
refactoring. In other cases, it is possible that the dereference was introduced
into code that already had the null check, but the developer mistakenly added
the dereference before the null check. This usually results in a null reference
exception. In any case, such a condition usually points to an inconsistency in
the code, which should be reviewed for correctness.

How it works:
The rule inspects null checks present in the code and determines whether they
are redundant. To do this, it examines all the code paths that lead to
the null check (for example, of variable "foo"). If it finds a dereferencing
of the variable "foo" along all these paths, then it reports a violation.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
When both the dereference and the null check are within the same function,
this almost always indicates a problem with the logic. When one of these
is in a different function, a more careful review is needed before
proceeding to fix the reported violation. Even though
an obvious solution may be to remove the null check, it is possible that
the null check is a protection against future changes.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Helps you detect code that is fraught with the danger of null dereferencing and find
fragments of dead code.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example which triggers a violation due to a problem with logic:

#include "stdio.h"

static void checkSequence(char cur[])
{
	if (cur[0] == '-') {
		printf("Error: only positive values are permitted");
		return;
	}
	// misplaced null check
	if (cur == 0) {
		printf("Error: null argument provided");
		return;
	}
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The misplaced null check should precede the array processing code:

#include "stdio.h"

static void checkSequence(char cur[])
{
	if (cur == 0) {
		printf("Error: null argument provided");
		return;
	}
	if (cur[0] == '-') {
		printf("Error: only positive values are permitted");
		return;
	}
}
