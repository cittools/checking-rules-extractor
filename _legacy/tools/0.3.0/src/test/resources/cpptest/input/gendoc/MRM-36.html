<STRONG>
Always provide empty brackets ([]) for delete when deallocating arrays [MRM-36-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Use the same form in corresponding calls to new and delete.
This rule checks calls to new and delete to make sure that
they use the same form; it reports a violation if you call
new[] but forget to use [] when calling delete. If you do
not use the same form in corresponding calls to new and delete, 
an incorrect number of destructors may be called.

BENEFITS

Prevents using different kinds of 'new' and 'delete' calls.
