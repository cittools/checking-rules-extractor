Be wary about using multiple inheritance of classes that are not abstract interfaces [OOP-07-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Be wary about using multiple inheritance of classes that are not abstract 
interfaces. Designs that use multiple inheritance can be very expressive,
but are harder to get right and easier to get wrong. In particular, 
state management is particularly hard in designs using multiple inheritance."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule allows for only one direct not interface parent class.
By interface class is meant class which has no member variables
and all member functions (except for destructor) are pure virtual.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Avoiding state in abstract interfaces simplifies the entire hierarchy design."

EXAMPLE

class A {
public:
    void foo1( );
};

class B {
public:
    void foo2( );
};

class C: public A, public B {   // Violation
};

REPAIR

<PRE>

class A {
public:
    void foo1( );
};

class B {
public:
    virtual void foo2( ) = 0;
};

class C: public A, public B {   // OK
};
