Avoid using unsecured shell functions that may be affected by shell metacharacters [SECURITY-11-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects code that uses environment functions:
popen, system, execlp, execvp, _exec, exec
According to David A. Wheeler (see reference below):
"Many systems, such as the command line shell and SQL interpreters, 
have "metacharacters" - characters that are not interpreted as data. 
Those characters are: { &amp; ; ` ' \ " | * ? ~ &lt; &gt; ^ ( ) [ ] { } $ \n \r }. 
Such characters might commands, or delimit data from commands or other data. 
If your program invokes those other systems and allows attackers to insert 
such metacharacters, the usual result is that an attacker can completely 
control your program. 
What makes the shell metacharacters particularly pervasive is that several 
important library calls, such as popen() and system() are implemented 
by calling the command shell, meaning that they will be affected by shell 
metacharacters too. 
Similarly, execlp() and execvp() may cause the shell to be called. 
Many guidelines suggest avoiding popen(), system(), execlp(), execvp() 
entirely and use execve() directly in C when trying to spawn a process."

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#ifdef __GNUC__
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#else
#include &lt;process.h&gt;
#endif

void main( void ) {
    execl( "c:\\command.com", "", "_execl", "", "" );   // Violation
}
