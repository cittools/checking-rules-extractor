Macros shall not be used [MISRA2008-16_2_1_a-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Macros are generally an obsolete construct inherited from C language. 
The main problems with macros are that they:
- are not type-safe
- are expanded by the preprocessor so debugging them is not possible
- can compile by pure luck creating ugly problems with the program


Exceptions:

Macros are almost never necessary in C++. Exceptions to this rule are:
- #ifdef
- #ifndef
- #if
- #if defined
when used as include guards and for conditional compilation.
