Constructors allowing for conversion should be made explicit [CODSTA-CPP-04-1]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Be wary of user-defined conversion functions.
Constructors allowing for conversion should be made explicit.
Constructors with one argument can be implicitly used by the compiler to
perform type conversions. Such calls may in the best case result in creating
and destroying temporary objects, affecting runtime, and in the worst, allow
the most meaningless code to compile. In the latter case, problems that could
be detected at compile time are pushed to run-time testing.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Generally improves runtime performance and predictability of program
behavior. May detect severe coding defects masked by the compiler.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

class A {
public:
    A( int i ) : _i( i ) {}  // Violation
    virtual ~A( ) {}
private:
    int _i;
};
 
int main( ) {
    return 0;
}

/* One argument constructors that are not meant for type conversion should
   be declared explicit. Conversions should be performed by conversion 
   functions rather than relying on implicit constructor calls. */

class A {
public:
    explicit A( int i ) : _i( i ) {}  // OK
    virtual ~A( ) {}
private:
    int _i;
};
 
int main( ) {
    return 0;
}
