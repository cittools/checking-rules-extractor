The right hand operand of a shift operator shall lie between zero and one less than the width in bits of the underlying type of the left hand operand [MISRA2008-5_8_1-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If, for example, the left-hand operand of a left-shift or right-shift is a 
16-bit integer, then it is important to ensure that this is shifted only by a 
number between 0 and 15 inclusive.

There are various ways of ensuring this rule is followed. The simplest is for 
the right-hand operand to be a constant (whose value can then be statically 
checked). Use of an unsigned integer type will ensure that the operand is 
non-negative, so then only the upper limit needs to be checked (dynamically at
run-time or by review). Otherwise both limits will need to be checked."
Rule makes assumptions about size of types: char has 8 bits, short has 16 bit,
int has 32 bit, long has 64 bit.
