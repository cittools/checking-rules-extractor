Declare a copy constructor for classes with dynamically allocated memory [JSF-76_b-2]
</STRONG>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks if a class, which uses 'new' to allocate its data member,
or 'delete' to deallocate its data member, has an explicitly defined copy
constructor.
See also: CODSTA-CPP-19, MRM-05, MRM-37, MRM-40, MRM-48, OOP-27, OOP-30, OOP-34


Exceptions:

Rule does not report violation if there's an copy constructor in a base
class which prevents implicitly declared copy constructor in this class 
from being used.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A copy constructor is recommended to avoid surprises when an object
is initialized using an object of the same type. If an object manages
the allocation and deallocation of an object on the heap (the managing
object has a pointer to the object to be created by the class' constructor),
only the value of the pointer will be copied. This can lead to two invocations
of the destructor for the same object (on the heap), probably resulting
in a run-time error."

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class MyClass{ // Violation
public:
    MyClass();
    ~MyClass(){ delete p; }
private:
    int *p;
};

MyClass::MyClass() {
    p = new int;
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class MyClass{ // OK
public:
    MyClass();
    MyClass(MyClass&amp;);
    ~MyClass(){ delete p; }
private:
    int *p;
};

MyClass::MyClass() {
    p = new int;
}
