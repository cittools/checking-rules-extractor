Never provide brackets ([]) for delete when deallocating non-arrays [MRM-35-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Use the same form in corresponding calls to new and delete.
This rule checks calls to new and delete to make sure that
they use the same form; it reports a violation if you call
new and you [] when calling delete. If you do not use the
same form in corresponding calls to new and delete, 
an incorrect number of destructors may be called.
