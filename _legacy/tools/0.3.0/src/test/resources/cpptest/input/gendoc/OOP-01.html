Base class copy constructor should be protected or public with smart pointer as parameter [OOP-01-3]
</STRONG>

<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Sliced objects aren't good. (...) 
There is a better way that portably achieves the goal of preventing slicing
and delivers more value to boot. The more general idiomatic solution is to
make the copy constructor for base classes protected"
See also: OOP-02


Exceptions:

"Some designs might require that the copy constructor of base classes
are left public. In that case, prefer passing by (smart) pointer to passing
by reference. Passing by pointer is much less vulnerable to slicing and
unwanted temporary construction."

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents using of sliced objects.
"Object slicing is automatic, invisible, and likely to bring wonderful
polymorphic designs to a screeching halt"

EXAMPLE

class A
{
public:
    A(A&amp;);  // Violation - copy constructor in public section 
            //             without smart pointer as parameter 
};

class B
{
private:
   B(B &amp;); // Violation  - copy constructor in private section  
};

class C
{
public:
    C(auto_ptr&lt;C&gt;); // OK

class D

protected:
    D(D&amp;);         // OK
