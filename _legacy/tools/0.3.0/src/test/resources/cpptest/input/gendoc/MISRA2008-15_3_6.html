DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"Where multiple handlers are provided in a single try-catch statement or
function-try-block for a derived class and some or all of its bases,
the handlers shall be ordered most-derived to base class.
When testing to see if the type of an exception matches the type of a handler,
a derived class exception will match with a handler for its base class.
If the base class handler is found before the handler for the derived class,
the base class handler will be used. The derived class handler is unreachable
code and can never be executed."
