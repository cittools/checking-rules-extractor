Implicit conversions which may result in a loss of information shall not be used [MISRA-043-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"C performs many type conversions implicitly and silently, so as to harmonize
types within an expression before evaluating it. Some of these conversions can
result in loss of information. Such implicit conversions shall not be used,
but explicit casts should be used instead.
As a general principle, avoid mixing arithmetic of different precisions in the 
same expression, and avoid mixing signed and unsigned integers in the same
expression. Mixed arithmetic normally entails implicit promotions and balancing
of types (i.e. conversions), some of which can lead to unexpected behaviour."
The rule reports a violation if in one expression (assignment, initialization,
arithmetic expression) are used two non-constant operands of different types.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule checks only the following types: signed/unsigned (char, short, int,
long, long long), float, double, long double and typedefs to mentioned types.
The fundamental type and typedef to this type the rule treats as the same type.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"Explicit casts should normally only be used in the case where a conversion 
which could result in a loss of information is specifically required by the 
programmer. If the static checking of implicit conversions is overridden by
the use of explicit casts in this way, then the programmer should be aware
of the issues of truncation and lost of precision associated with the operation,
and should provide appropriate checking of values in the code"

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void foo(unsigned int ui, signed int i)
{
  float f;
  unsigned short us = ui; /* Violation */

  ui = i;                 /* Violation */
  i = f;                  /* Violation */
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo(unsigned int ui, signed int i)
{
  float f;
  unsigned short us = (unsigned short)ui; /* OK */

  ui = (unsigned int)i;                   /* OK */
  i = (signed int)f;                      /* OK */
