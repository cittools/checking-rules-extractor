Avoid initialization order problems across translation units [INIT-12-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If initialization of a non-local static object in one translation 
unit uses a non-local static object in a different translation
unit, the object it uses could be uninitialized, because the
relative order of initialization of non-local static objects 
defined in different translation units is undefined.
Fortunately, a small design change eliminates the problem
entirely. All that has to be done is to move each non-local
static object into its own function, where it's declared 
static. These functions return references to the objects
they contain. Clients then call the functions instead 
of referring to the objects. In other words, non-local 
static objects are replaced with local static objects."

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This approach is founded on C++'s guarantee that local 
static objects are initialized when the object's definition
is first encountered during a call to that function. So if
you replace direct accesses to non-local static objects 
with calls to functions that return references to local 
static objects, you're guaranteed that the references you
get back will refer to initialized objects. As a bonus, if you
never call a function emulating a non-local static object, 
you never incur the cost of constructing and destructing 
the object, something that can't be said for true non-local
static objects."
