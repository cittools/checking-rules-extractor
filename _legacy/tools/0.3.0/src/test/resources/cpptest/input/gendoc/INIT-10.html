List members in an initialization list in the order in which they are declared [INIT-10-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Recall that the destructors for the members of an object are always called 
in the inverse order of their constructors. Thus, if members were initialized 
in the order of their appearance in an initialization list, compilers would 
have to keep track of the order in which the members were initialized for each 
object, just to ensure that the destructors would be called in the right order. 
That would be an expensive proposition. To avoid that overhead, the order 
of construction and destruction is the same for all objects of a given type, 
and the order of members in an initialization list is ignored."
In example section variable b from class A will not be initialized as we 
assumed (initialized by the same value).

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

class A {
public:
    A( int x ) : a( x ), b( a ) {}    // Violation - b is declared before a
private:
    int b;
    int a;
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B( int );
private:
    int a;
    float b;
};

B::B( int y ) : b( 5 ), A( 1 ), a( y ) {}   // Violation - a is declared before b

class A {
public:
    A( int x ) : a( x ), b( a ) {}   // OK - a is declared before b
private:
    int a;
    int b;
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B( int );
private:
    float b;
    int a;
};

B::B( int y ) : b( 5 ), A( 1 ), a( y ) {}   // OK - b is declared before a
