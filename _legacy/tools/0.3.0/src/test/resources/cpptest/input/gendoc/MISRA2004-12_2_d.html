Don't write code that depends on the order of evaluation of function calls [MISRA2004-12_2_d-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Apart from a few operators (notably the function call operator (), &amp;&amp;, ||, ?: 
and , (comma)) the order in which sub-expressions are evaluated is unspecified 
and can vary. This means that no reliance can be placed on the order of 
evaluation of sub-expressions, and in particular no reliance can be placed on 
the order in which side effects occur.
Functions may have additional effects when they are called (e.g. modifying some
global data). Dependence on order of evaluation could be avoided by invoking the
function prior to the expression that uses it, making use of a temporary 
variable for the value."

Rule reports violation if in one expression are called two functions,
where the first function takes as argument a pointer or a reference
to a non-const variable and modifies this variable, and the second 
function takes as argument the same variable as first. 


Exceptions:

Only one level of function calls is checked.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents evaluation of expression dependent on compiler version.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

int foo(int* ptr)
{
    (*ptr)++;
    return 0;
}
int bar(int local_param)
{
    return local_param;
}

void foo_t(int i, int j)
{
    i = foo(&amp;j) + bar(j);    // Violation
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

int foo(int* ptr)
{
    (*ptr)++;
    return 0;
}
int bar(int local_param)
{
    return local_param;
}

void foo_t(int i, int j)
{
    int temp = foo(&amp;j);
    i = temp + bar(j);    // OK
}
