Protect against integer overflow/underflow from tainted data [BD-SECURITY-INTOVERF-1]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects cases where unvalidated input (tainted data) is used in an arithmetic
operation that can result in numeric overflow (when the mathematical result of an operation
is greater than the highest value that can be represented by the operation's result type)
or underflow (when mathematical result of an operation is lower than the lowest value
that can be represented by the operation's result type) and is later used in a dangerous
operation.

Since overflow may be expected in many cases, the rule tries to avoid false positives by reporting
a violation only if a value that can be overflowed is later used in one of the following
dangerous cases:

 - As a memory buffer size in a memory allocation operation (overflow may cause allocation
   of a huge memory chunk and possibly denial of service)

 - In a loop condition (overflow may lead to an infinite loop and thus to denial of service)

 - In pointer arithmetic (may cause accessing memory at illegal address and thus undefined
   behavior, including application crashes)


Data from the following data sources are considered tainted:

   * Parameters of the main() function
   * Network

Additional sources of tainted data can be defined by parameterizing the rule.
For details, see the PARAMETERS section.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Integer overflow is a serious security threat because it can be used to cause application crashes
and denial of service.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule can be parameterized so that data from the following data sources are considered tainted
(in addition to those previously listed in the DESCRIPTION section):

   * Files
   * Pipes
   * Stream-oriented APIs (std::istream, CArchive and CFile from MFC)
   * Low-level input (Windows API, POSIX)
   * Console
   * Environment variables

The rule can be parameterized with a list of validating functions.
Any validating function can be defined as:
   * returning benign data, and/or;
   * making its parameter(s) benign, and/or;
   * making this-object benign.

Validation functions allow this data to be safely passed
to dangerous functions.

Below is the description of columns that allow you to define different aspects of
functions in validating function table:

* The 'Enabled' column can be used to temporarily disable some of the defined functions
  for BugDetective analysis.

* The 'Fully qualified type name' column must be filled with the fully qualified name of the type
  that declares the function. Use '*' if you want to describe a function declared in any type
  or namespace, or a global function declared outside of any type or namespace.

* The 'Function name' column should contain name of the described function.

* The '+ definitions in subclasses' column is used to indicate whether the current row will
  apply to functions with the given name defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this
  applies to both instance and non-instance functions.

Other columns allow you to describe which of the data are affected by a given function:

* The '"this" object is validated' column is used to specify that the function cleans the object on which
  it is called.

* The 'returns validated data' column is used to specify that the function cleans its return value.

* The 'Numbers of the parameters that are validated (1-based)' column is used to specify that
  the function cleans some of its parameters. Use a comma to separate parameters' indexes
  or use '*' to specify that all parameters are affected.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that will trigger violations:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

#define BUFFER_SIZE 64
char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

#define MAX_LEN 1000000L

char decode(char c)
{
	/* Decode character */
	return c;
}

char* readMessage(int socket, char *header, int len)
{
	int i, header_len;
	long msg_len, total_len;
	char *msg;

	recv(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, MSG_NOSIGNAL);
	msg_len = atol(buffer);
	header_len = strlen(header);
	total_len = header_len;
	total_len += msg_len;

	msg = (char*)malloc(total_len); /* VIOLATION, USAGE OF OVERFLOWED VALUE */
	if (!msg) {
		return 0;
	}

	strcpy(msg, header);

	recv(socket, msg + msg_len, msg_len, MSG_NOSIGNAL);

	for (i = header_len; i &lt; total_len; i++) { /* VIOLATION, USAGE OF OVERFLOWED VALUE */
		msg[i] = decode(msg[i]);
	}
	return msg;
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The following code will not trigger a violation:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

#define BUFFER_SIZE 64
char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

#define MAX_LEN 1000000L

char decode(char c)
{
	/* Decode character */
	return c;
}

char* readMessage(int socket, char *header, int len)
{
	int i, header_len;
	long msg_len, total_len;
	char *msg;

	recv(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, MSG_NOSIGNAL);
	msg_len = atol(buffer);
	header_len = strlen(header);
	total_len = header_len;
	total_len += msg_len;

	if ((total_len &lt; 0) || (total_len &gt; MAX_LEN)) { /* check that total_len is within an acceptable range */
		return 0;
	}

	msg = (char*)malloc(total_len); /* NO VIOLATION */
	if (!msg) {
		return 0;
	}

	strcpy(msg, header);

	recv(socket, msg + msg_len, msg_len, MSG_NOSIGNAL);

	for (i = header_len; i &lt; total_len; i++) { /* NO VIOLATION */
		msg[i] = decode(msg[i]);
	}
	return msg;
