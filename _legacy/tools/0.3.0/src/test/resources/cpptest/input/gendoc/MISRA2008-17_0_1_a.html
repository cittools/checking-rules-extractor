DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"It is generally bad practice to #undef a macro which is defined in the 
standard library. It is also bad practice to #define a macro name which
is a C reserved identifier or C keyword which is the name of any macro,
object or function in the standard library.
For example, there are some specific reserved words and function names 
which are known to give rise to undefined behaviour if they are redefined or
undefined, including defined, _ _LINE_ _, _ _FILE_ _, _ _DATE_ _, _ _TIME_ _, 
_ _STDC_ _, errno and assert. Generally, all identifiers that begin with
the underscore character are reserved."
