If you'd like to support mixed-mode operations make operators a non-member functions [CODSTA-CPP-20-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks declared two-argument operators to make sure they are proper
for the class type used. You know you'd like to support arithmetic operations
like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., but you're unsure whether
you should implement them via a member function, a non-member function. 
If class contains a conversion operators or constructors allowing implicit
conversion you should define operators global because it makes operations
commutative. operator&gt;&gt; and operator&lt;&lt; are never members. If f is operator&gt;&gt; 
or operator&lt;&lt;, make f a non-member function. Here the goal is a natural calling
syntax; earlier we were concerned about implicit type conversions.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Differentiating among functions leads to more object-oriented code
with behavior that is more intuitive to use and maintain.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class A{
public:
    A(int x=0);
    A&amp; operator+(A&amp; a); // Violation (could be global)
};

class B{
public:
    istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp; input);                   // Violation
                                                           // should be global
    ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; output) { as = "aaaa"; }; // Violation
                                                           // should be friend
private: 
    char* as;
};

<PRE>

class A{
public:
    A(int x=0);
};

A&amp; operator+(A&amp; a, A&amp; b); // OK

class B{
public:
    friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; output, B&amp; out);
private:
    char* as;
};

istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp; input,const B&amp; in);   // OK
ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; output, B&amp; out) {     // OK
    out.as = "aaaa";
    return output; 
};
