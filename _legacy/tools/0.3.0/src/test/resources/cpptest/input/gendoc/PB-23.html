DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects where an object containing pointer member fields has been
passed by value using a compiler-generated copy constructor. Passing such
objects by reference avoids possible problems with improper bitwise copying
member pointers.
If a class/struct has non-static pointer member fields, has no declared copy
constructor, and class/struct object is passed by value then the rule reports
a violation message.
