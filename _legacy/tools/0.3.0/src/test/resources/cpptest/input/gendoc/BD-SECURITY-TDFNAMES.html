Protect against file name injection [BD-SECURITY-TDFNAMES-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects when possibly tainted data is used as a filename or path in file
manipulating functions, which could cause a file name injection. The rule supports file manipulation
functions from the standard C and C++ libraries as well as those defined by POSIX.

Data from the following data sources are considered tainted:

   * Parameters of the main() function
   * Network

Additional sources of tainted data can be defined by parameterizing the rule.
For details, see the PARAMETERS section.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
If unverified data appears in file names, then an attacker could potentially gain
access to any file on the system, providing specially-prepared malicious data.

Enforcing this rule will help to protect against the OWASP 2007 Top 10
application vulnerability "A3 - Malicious File Execution".


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule can be parameterized so that data from the following data sources are considered tainted
(in addition to those previously listed in the DESCRIPTION section):

   * Files
   * Pipes
   * Stream-oriented APIs (std::istream, CArchive and CFile from MFC)
   * Low-level input (Windows API, POSIX)
   * Console
   * Environment variables

The rule can be parameterized with a list of validating functions.
Any validating function can be defined as:
   * returning benign data, and/or;
   * making its parameter(s) benign, and/or;
   * making this-object benign.

Validation functions allow this data to be safely passed
to dangerous functions.

Below is the description of columns which allow to define different aspects of
functions in validating function table: 

* The 'Enabled' column can be used to temporarily disable some of the defined functions
  for BugDetective analysis.

* The 'Fully qualified type name' column must be filled with the fully qualified name of the type
  that declares the function. Use '*' if you want to describe function declared in any type
  or namespace, or a global function declared outside of any type or namespace.

* The 'Function name' column should contain name of the described function.

* The '+ definitions in subclasses' column is used to indicate whether the current row will
  apply to functions with the given in name defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this
  applies to both instance and non-instance functions.
  
Other columns allow to describe which of the data are affected by a given function:

* The '"this" object is validated' column is used to specify that the function cleans object on which
  it is called.

* The 'returns validated data' column is used to specify that the function cleans its return value.

* The 'Numbers of the parameters that are validated (1-based)' column is used to specify that
  the function cleans some of its parameters. List parameters' indexes separated by comma
  or use '*' to specify that all parameters are affected.

Also, there is an option that determines whether numerical data should be considered tainted.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Consider an application that stores some user-specific data in files on a server (for
instance, a library with user stories) using the story name given by the user as the file name.

The following code may be used to create a specific file and add the
story contents:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

void saveStory(int socket)
{
    char storyName[50];
    char storyContent[200];

    /* Receive story from socket */
    recv(socket, storyName, 50, 0);
    recv(socket, storyContent, 200, 0);
    FILE* f = fopen(storyName, "w"); /* File name injection */
    fprintf(f, "%s", storyContent);
    fclose(f);
}

In this case, if an attacker provides "c:\\windows\\system.ini" as a story name
and some specially prepared configuration file contents as story contents,
then after saving this "story", the system-critical .ini file can be modified
and some dangerous contents can be saved there.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Validate data prior to its usage:

	void saveStory(int socket)
	{
		/* ... */
		recv(socket, storyName, 50, MSG_WAITALL);
		storyName = validate(storyName);

		recv(socket, storyContent, 200, MSG_WAITALL);
		storyContent = validate(storyContent);
		/* ... */
	}

	char* validate(char*)
	{
	   // verify the input so that the file can only be stored in the current directory only,
	   // not under a user defined path
	}
