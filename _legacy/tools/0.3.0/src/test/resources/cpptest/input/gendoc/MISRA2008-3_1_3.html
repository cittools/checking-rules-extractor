DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When an array is declared with external linkage, its size shall be stated 
explicitly or defined implicitly by initialisation.
Although it is possible to declare an array of incomplete type and access 
its elements, it is safer to do so when the size of the array may be 
explicitly determined."
