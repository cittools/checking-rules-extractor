All variables shall have a defined value before they are used [MISRA2008-8_5_1-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The intent of this rule is that all variables shall have been written to before
they are read. This does not necessarily require initialisation at declaration.
Ideally a static check should be performed for any automatic variables which 
might be used without having first been assigned a value"
See also: INIT-06, INIT-10, INIT-14, BD-PB-NOTINIT



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that local variable might be initialized 
by passing its non-const pointer to an external function.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents reading from uninitialized variables.
