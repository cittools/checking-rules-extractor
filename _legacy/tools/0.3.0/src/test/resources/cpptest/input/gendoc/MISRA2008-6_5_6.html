DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A loop-control-variable other than the loop-counter which is modified
in statement shall have type bool.
A loop-control-variable is any variable occurring in for-init-statement,
condition or expression.
A loop-counter is a loop-control-variable that is:
  - Initialized in, or prior to, for-init-statement; and
  - an operand to a relational operator in condition; and
  - modified in expression.
loop-control-variables are typically used to terminate a for loop early.
The code is easier to understand if this is done with the use
of Boolean values"

The rule assumes that variable or parameter might be modified by passing
its non-const pointer or reference to an external function.
