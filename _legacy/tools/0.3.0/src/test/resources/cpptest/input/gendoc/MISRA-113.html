DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

All the members of a structure (or union) shall be named.

The "bit field" facility in C is one of the most poorly defined parts
of the language. There are two main uses to which bit-fields could be put:

1) To access individual bits, or group of bits, in larger data-types,
in conjunction with unions (see rule 110).
2) To allow flags or other short-length data to be packed to save storage space

The packing together of short-length data to economise on storage is the only
acceptable use of bit fields envisaged in this document.

Provided the elements of the structure are only ever accessed by their name,
the programmer needs to make no assumptions about the way the bit fields
are stored within the structure.

This rules checks that all declared bit fields have names.
