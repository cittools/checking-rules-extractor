Pass objects by reference instead of by value [JSF-125_a-2]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects where an object has been passed by value instead
of by reference. Passing objects by reference is more efficient 
than passing by value because no new objects are being created
and because it avoids the "slicing problem."
See also: PB-20, PB-23, OPT-33

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Improves code consistency and runtime performance.


Exceptions:

There also may be a situation where the object is so small that it would be 
more efficient to pass by value instead of by reference.
Due to C++'s type system and the fact that QString, RWCString and CString  
are implicitly shared, they may be treated like ints or other basic types.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class A {
public:
    const A violation( A a ) {       // Violation - passing parameter by value
        return a;                    // Violation - returning by value
    }
};

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class A {
public:
    const A&amp; valid( const A &amp;a ) {   // OK
        return a;                    // OK
    }
};
