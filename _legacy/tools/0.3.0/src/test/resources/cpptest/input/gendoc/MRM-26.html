Write operator delete if you write operator new [MRM-26-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule makes sure that if you write your own version of operator new,
you also write a corresponding operator delete. If you write delete when
you write new, you ensure that new and delete share the same assumptions.
