Subtraction between pointers shall only be applied to pointers that address elements of the same array [MISRA2008-5_0_17-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Subtraction of pointers only gives well-defined results if the two pointers 
point (or at least behave as if they point) into the same array object."
Drawbacks: For more complex code rule may not be able to check if there is 
applied pointer arithmetic to pointers that address an array or array element.
For such cases the rule may report false positives.
For example:
void foo( ) { 
    int a[10], i;
    int* p1,* p2,* p3,* p4,* p5; 

    p1 = a; i = p1 - a;    // OK
    p2 = p1;i = p2 - a;    // OK
    p3 = p2;i = p3 - a;    // OK
    p4 = p3;i = p4 - a;    // Violation - false positive
    p5 = p4;i = p5 - a;    // Violation - false positive
}

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Rule makes the code more readable and less confusing.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo( int a[] ) {
    int* p1 = 0;
    int* p2;
    int* p3 = a;
    int i;

    i = p1 - p2;   // Violation
    i = p2 - a;    // Violation
    i = p3 - a;    // OK
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Do not apply pointer subtraction to pointers that address elements 
of different arrays.
