DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

C does not support the nesting of comments even though 
some compilers support this as a language extension.
A comment begins with /* and continues until the first */ is encountered.
Any /* occurring inside a comment is a violation of this rule.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Nested comments are not supported by C and can lead to confusion.
