DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"No function should be longer than what can be printed on a single sheet
of paper in a standard reference format with one line per statement
and one line per declaration. Typically, this means no more than about
60 lines of code per function."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule counts non-empty lines inside body of function.
Lines containing only comment are not counted.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Each function should be a logical unit in the code that is understandable
and verifiable as a unit. It is much harder to understand a logical unit that
spans multiple screens on a computer display or multiple pages when printed.
Excessively long functions are often a sign of poorly structured code."

EXAMPLE

void foo( int x )     // Violation

    // ...
    // more than 60 lines of constants, declarations, expressions, 
    // statements, types
    // ...
}
