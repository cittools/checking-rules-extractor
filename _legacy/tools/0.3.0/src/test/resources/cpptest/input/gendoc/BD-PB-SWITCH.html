Avoid switch with unreachable branches [BD-PB-SWITCH-2]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule identifies unreachable switch branches-- one kind of dead code.
Dead code often appears in the course of refactorings and during code evolution--
especially when code is edited by multiple developers. Often, the existence of unreachable
switch branches indicates logical errors in the code (as shown below in the example section).

How it works:
the rule inspects switch statements present in the code and determines whether they 
have unreachable branches or not. For this, it examines all the code paths that lead 
to the switch statement. If it finds that on all these paths some of the case branches 
of the switch statement are unreachable, it reports a violation.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
In order to make good use of this rule, the check box "Do not report violations
when cause cannot be shown" in BugDetective configuration pane must be unchecked.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
N/A


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
It is possible to specify whether or not to report a violation for an unreachable 
default branch which is not declared explicitly. This is controlled by the check box 
labeled "Report about unreachable default branch even if it's not explicitly defined".


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Helps you keep code in good shape and weed out logical inconsistencies as soon as they
appear.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example which triggers a violation ("Do not report
violations when cause cannot be shown" check box in BugDetective
configuration pane must be unchecked):

#include "stdio.h"

enum Figures {
	SPHERE,
	CIRCLE,
	CUBE,
	SQUARE,
	HIMESPHERE
};

static void guessFigure(int round, int volumetric)
{
    int figure;
    if (round &amp;&amp; volumetric) {
        figure = SPHERE;
    } else if (round &amp;&amp; !volumetric) {
        figure = CIRCLE; 
    } else if (!round &amp;&amp; volumetric) {
        figure = CUBE;
    } else {
    	figure = SQUARE;
    }
    
    switch (figure) {
		case SQUARE:
			printf("This is a sphere");
			break;
        case HIMESPHERE:
			printf("This is a hemispere");
            break;
        case CIRCLE:
			printf("This is a circle");
            break;
        case CUBE:
			printf("This is a cube");
            break;
		default:
			printf("This is a square");
			break;
	}
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
To repair the code, remove the unreachable branch:

#include "stdio.h"

enum Figures {
	SPHERE,
	CIRCLE,
	CUBE,
	SQUARE,
	HIMESPHERE
};

static void guessFigure(int round, int volumetric)
{
    int figure;
    if (round &amp;&amp; volumetric) {
        figure = SPHERE;
    } else if (round &amp;&amp; !volumetric) {
        figure = CIRCLE; 
    } else if (!round &amp;&amp; volumetric) {
        figure = CUBE;
    } else {
    	figure = SQUARE;
    }
    
    switch (figure) {
		case SQUARE:
			printf("This is a sphere");
			break;
        case CIRCLE:
			printf("This is a circle");
            break;
        case CUBE:
			printf("This is a cube");
            break;
		default:
			printf("This is a square");
			break;
	}
}
