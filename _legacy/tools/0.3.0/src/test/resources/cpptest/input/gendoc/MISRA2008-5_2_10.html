DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"It is the intention of the rule that when the increment or decrement operator
is used, it should be the only side-effect in the statement.
The use of increment and decrement operators in combination with other 
arithmetic operators is not recommended because:
 - It can significantly impair the readability of the code
 - It introduces additional side effects into a statement with the potential for
   undefined behaviour
It is safer to use these operations in isolation from any other arithmetic 
operators."

BENEFITS

Improves readability and maintainability. 
Reduces risk of potential undefined behaviour
caused by additional side effects
