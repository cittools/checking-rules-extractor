The assignment operator must assign all members, including those in base classes [JSF-83-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A class may contain many data members as well as exist within
an inheritance hierarchy. Hence the assignment operator must
assign all members, including those in base classes. 
Rule reports a violation message if base class assignment 
operator is not called or not all base classes' member variables
are assigned within derived class assignment operator.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Assign to all member variables in operator= function
in order to prevent data corruption.
