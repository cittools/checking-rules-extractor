DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Array indexing is the only acceptable form of pointer arithmetic, because it is
clearer and hence less error prone than pointer manipulation. This rule bans the
explicit calculation of pointer values. Array indexing shall only be applied to 
objects defined as an array type. Any explicitly calculated pointer value has 
the potential to access unintended or invalid memory addresses. Pointers may go 
out of bounds of arrays or structures, or may even point to effectively 
arbitrary locations."



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Array type with unspecified length is treat as a pointer.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves safety of the code.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

typedef int* apInt[] ;
apInt* rule12;         /* Violation */

REPAIR
