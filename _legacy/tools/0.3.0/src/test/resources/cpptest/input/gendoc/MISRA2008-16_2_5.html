DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"It is undefined behaviour if the \ character is used between &lt; and &gt;
delimiters or between the " delimiters in a header name preprocessing token.
Note that this rule is only advisory, since some environments use \ as a file
name delimiter. Compilers for these environments often support the use
of / in #include directives."
