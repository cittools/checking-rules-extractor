.NAME Initialize for loop counter in for head

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
Loop counters (in for loops) are to be initialized in the initialization 
statement within the loop.
The loop counter is determined by the third element of the loop head, 
which is most frequently used to increment the loop counter.
In all the following examples, i is the loop counter. 

Justification:
--------------
This way the loop counter is certain to have been initialized, and with a value 
that is visible alongside with the loop condition and increment. The loop is 
easier to understand and to control.

Example:
--------
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) ... // ok 
for (int i; i &lt; 10; i++) ...     // violation
for (int j = 0; j &lt; 10; i++) ... // violation
for (int j = 10; i &lt; j; i++) ... // violation
for (int j = 1; i &lt; funct(j); i+=j) ... // violation
