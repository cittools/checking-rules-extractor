.NAME Try Blocks in Destructors

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
If it is not empty, the definition of a constructor must contain a "try" 
and "catch" block.
(This rule relates to Item 11 in "More Effective C++", Scott Meyers).

Justification:
--------------
Prevents the call of terminate in case of exception propagation, and helps ensure
that destructors do everything they are supposed to do.
