.NAME Distinguish between Prefix and Postfix Forms of Increment and Decrement Operators

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
Increment and decrement operators must be declared in the same manner as 
in the following example:
class Example {
  public:
    Example& operator++();          // prefix ++
    const Example operator++(int);  // postfix ++
    Example& operator--();          // prefix --
    const Example operator--(int);  // postfix --
}
(This rule relates to Item 6 in "More Effective C++", Scott Meyers).

Justification:
--------------
Keeps the consistency with built-in types.
