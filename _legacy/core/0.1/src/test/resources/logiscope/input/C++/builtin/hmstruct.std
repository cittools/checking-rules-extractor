.NAME Header module structure

.DESCRIPTION

Definition:
-----------
To prevent multiple inclusions of header files, the main structure of 
these files should be:

#ifndef &lt;IDENT&gt;
#define &lt;IDENT&gt;
...
#endif
 
where &lt;IDENT&gt; is an identifier built from the name of the header file.

The comparison is made only on alphanumeric characters and is not case sensitive.
The part of the filename taken into account is between the MINth and the MAXth 
characters (including them). This character string should be found in the 
identifier according to the above comparison rules.

Parameters:
----------
A MINMAX couple of values giving the part of the filename to take into account, 
and a list of character strings giving the list of file types to be considered as 
header files for this rule.
The types are those defined by the metric type .

Example:
--------

// if the parameter is MINMAX 4 9,the following content 
// of file div_audit_env.h is correct

#ifndef AUDIT_H
#define AUDIT_H
...
#endif
