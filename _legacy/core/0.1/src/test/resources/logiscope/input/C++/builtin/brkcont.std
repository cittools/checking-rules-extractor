A string identifying the type of checking:

* "in_switch" (or no parameter) means that the break are allowed in switch 
statements, break and continue are forbidden everywhere else,

* "without_label" means that any break or continue without a label is allowed,

* "with_label" means that any break and continue with a label is allowed,
break and continue without a label is forbidden everywhere.

Like a goto, these instructions break down code structure. Prohibiting them
in loops makes the code easier to understand.
